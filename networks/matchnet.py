    Matching networks extract embedding vectors for both support and query images. Then they refine
    these embedding by using the context of the whole support set, using LSTMs. Finally they compute
    query labels using their cosine similarity to support images.
    Be careful: while some methods use Cross Entropy Loss for episodic training, Matching Networks
    output log-probabilities, so you'll want to use Negative Log Likelihood Loss.
